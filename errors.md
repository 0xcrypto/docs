## Installation

Begin by installing this package through Composer. Edit your project's `composer.json` file to require `laravelcollective/errors` or simply run:

```bash
$ composer require laravelcollective/errors
```

<a name="important"></a>
## Important

This package is very generic and simply publishes some files to your application.

<a name="publish"></a>
## Publish

```bash
$ php artisan vendor:publish
```

<a name="layout"></a>
## Layout

There are two main layouts. The expected illustrated layout with the elegant SVGs is `illustrated` but you can also use the `branded` layout if you want to inject Brand images with a solid color sidebar.
